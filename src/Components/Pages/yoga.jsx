              If you can stay in this pose for several minutes, it's a great way to end your session. Five to 10 minutes in a meditative state in Goddess Pose can help you relax.Stay in a reclined position with your knees bent.
              Release your knees out to the sides and down to your mat.
              Bring the bottoms of your feet together. Placing a bolster under the length of your spine can feel great here</p>

Bring both legs outstretched for a forward bend.
Lengthen the spine in a seated position before coming forward. Imagine the pelvis as a bowl that is tipping forward as you come dow</p>
